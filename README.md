# hello-world
My first repository on GitHub.
Hi my name is Diogo and currently im in the Unniversity studying software engineering. I am a curious person and a fanatic of technologies with great need to improve my learning.
I like it when people criticize my work, because I believe in a work considered "good", there is always room for perfection.
